# Interpretable-Machine-Learning
An example of Interpretable Machine Learning applied to Breast Cancer Diagnostic Data.

In the code you will see how to fit the following classifiers: {Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, Support Vector Classifiers and a MLP}.

I then select one of the best performing black-box models and perform Post-Hoc analysis to try to understand how the independent variables are influencing the dependent variable (Whether the tumors were benign or malignent).
